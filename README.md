## 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (10 MINUTES)

### STEP 1: Create Netlify Account

1. Go to: **https://netlify.com**
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Use GitHub, GitLab, or Email
4. **FREE forever** - no credit card needed!

**Method A: Drag & Drop (Easiest!)**

1. **ZIP this folder:**
   - Right-click the `gelatocodeai` folder
   - Select "Compress" or "Send to → Compressed folder"
   - You'll get `gelatocodeai.zip`

2. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Login to https://app.netlify.com
   - You'll see: **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"**
   - Click **"Deploy manually"** or drag & drop area

3. **Drag the gelatocodeai folder:**
   - Simply drag the FOLDER (not the zip!)
   - Or click "Browse to upload"
   - Select the whole folder

4. **Wait 30 seconds:**
   - Netlify processes your site
   - You'll see: **"Site deployed!"**
   - You get a random URL like: `random-name-123456.netlify.app`
